Day Assignment: 
1. Cricket Ground Boundry Sides Distances from batsman (from Pavilion End)
        Leg Side 
        Off Side  
        Straight 
        Third Man  
    Compare two cricket grounds:
        find the shortest distance from each ground 
        and compare two ground based on shortest distance 
            check which is preferred ground for batsman 

    C#: CricketGround{ LegSideDistance: int, 
        OffSideDistace: int, 
        StraightDistance: int, 
        ThirdManDistance: int }
    - int FindShortestDistance()
        among four distance find min 
    - bool IsShortestDistanceGt(CricketGround other)     
    
    C3: UserOfCricketGround will compare two grounds 
        will say which ground is preferred ground 
2.  Circle { Radius: int }
        - float Circumference() 
        - bool IsCircumferenceGt(Circle other)
    TestCircle 
3.  BikeRaceTrack
        { Distance: int }
        - bool IsGt(BikeRaceTrack other)
    TestBikeRaceTrack
4.  ComplexNumber { Real: int, Imaginary: int}
        - ComplexNumber Add(ComplexNumber other)
    TestComplexNumber for addition 
        (3 + i4)
     +  (5 + i3) 
     =  (8 + i7)
