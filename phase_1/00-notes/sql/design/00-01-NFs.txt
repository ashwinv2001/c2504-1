UNF: with duplicate, with repeating groups 
1NF: no repeating group. we will have key.
Partial dependency means non-key depends not fully on key. 
2NF: no duplicate by no partial dependency. 
    if 1NF to 2NF, 
        we will have one or more new table(s).
        we may FK also.
Transitive dependency means 
    non-key 
    depends on another non-key which 
    depends on key.
3NF: no duplicate by no transitive dependency. 
    if 2NF to 3NF, 
        we will have one or more new table(s).
        we may FK also.
