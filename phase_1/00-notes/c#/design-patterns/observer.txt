The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern 
that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, 
so when one object (the subject) changes its state, 
all its dependent objects (observers) are notified and 
updated automatically. 

This pattern is useful 
for implementing distributed event-handling systems 
where a change in one component should notify and 
update other dependent components.

Key Concepts of Observer Pattern:

1. Subject: 
    The object 
    that holds the state and 
    sends notifications 
    to observers when its state changes.
2. Observer: 
    The objects that need 
    to be updated 
    when the state of the subject changes.
3. Notification: 
    The mechanism used 
    to inform observers of state changes.

Components:

1. Subject Interface: 
    Defines methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers.
2. Concrete Subject: 
    Implements the Subject interface and maintains the state.
3. Observer Interface: 
    Defines the method that will be called to update the observer.
4. Concrete Observer: 
    Implements the Observer interface and updates itself based on changes 
    in the subject.

Implementation in C

Here's an example of how to implement the Observer pattern in C. 
We'll create a simple weather monitoring system 
where the weather station (subject) 
notifies various displays (observers) 
of weather changes.

Subject Interface

```csharp
// Subject interface
public interface IWeatherStation
{
    void Attach(IWeatherDisplay observer);
    void Detach(IWeatherDisplay observer);
    void Notify();
}
```

Concrete Subject

```csharp
// Concrete Subject
public class WeatherStation : IWeatherStation
{
    private readonly List<IWeatherDisplay> _observers = new List<IWeatherDisplay>();
    private float _temperature;

    public float Temperature
    {
        get => _temperature;
        set
        {
            _temperature = value;
            Notify();
        }
    }

    public void Attach(IWeatherDisplay observer)
    {
        _observers.Add(observer);
    }

    public void Detach(IWeatherDisplay observer)
    {
        _observers.Remove(observer);
    }

    public void Notify()
    {
        foreach (var observer in _observers)
        {
            observer.Update(_temperature);
        }
    }
}
```

Observer Interface

```csharp
// Observer interface
public interface IWeatherDisplay
{
    void Update(float temperature);
}
```

Concrete Observer

```csharp
// Concrete Observer
public class TemperatureDisplay : IWeatherDisplay
{
    public void Update(float temperature)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Temperature Display: The current temperature is {temperature}Â°C");
    }
}
```

Client Code

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a weather station (subject)
        var weatherStation = new WeatherStation();

        // Create displays (observers)
        var tempDisplay = new TemperatureDisplay();

        // Attach observers to the weather station
        weatherStation.Attach(tempDisplay);

        // Change the temperature and notify observers
        weatherStation.Temperature = 25.0f;
        weatherStation.Temperature = 30.0f;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Subject Interface (`IWeatherStation`): 
    Defines methods 
    for managing observers and notifying them of changes.
2. Concrete Subject (`WeatherStation`): 
    Implements the `IWeatherStation` interface and manages 
    the state (`Temperature`). When the temperature changes, 
    it calls `Notify()` to update all observers.
3. Observer Interface (`IWeatherDisplay`): 
    Defines the method `Update` that will be called by the subject.
4. Concrete Observer (`TemperatureDisplay`): 
    Implements the `IWeatherDisplay` interface and updates 
    its display when notified of changes.
5. Client Code: 
    Demonstrates how to use the Observer pattern. 
    It creates a weather station and attaches an observer to it. 
    When the weather station's temperature changes, 
    the observer is notified and updates its display.

Summary:

- Observer Pattern: 
    Allows a subject to notify multiple observers about changes, 
    ensuring that all observers are updated consistently.
- Decoupling: 
    Promotes loose coupling between the subject and observers, 
    making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
- Use Cases: 
    Useful in implementing event-driven systems, 
    such as user interfaces, messaging systems, and 
    real-time notifications.
