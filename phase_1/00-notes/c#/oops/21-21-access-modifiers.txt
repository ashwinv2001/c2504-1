and the entities that can use them:

public: 
   Access isn't restricted.
protected: 
   Access is limited to the containing class or types 
   derived from the containing class.
internal: 
   Access is limited to the current assembly.
protected internal: 
   Access is limited to the current assembly or types 
   derived from the containing class.
private: 
   Access is limited to the containing type.
private protected: 
   Access is limited to the containing class or 
   types derived from the containing class within the current assembly.

Constructors

1. Constructors:
   - Default Constructor: 
        Used to initialize fields with default values.
   - Parameterized Constructor: 
        Used to initialize fields with specific values passed as arguments.
   - Copy Constructor: 
        Used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
   - Static Constructor: 
        Used to initialize static members of the class, 
        invoked automatically before the first instance is created.
   - Private Constructor: 
        Used to prevent instantiation of a class,
        often used in singleton patterns.

2. Property Initializations:
   - Default values: 
        Properties are initialized 
        with default values directly 
        in the class.
   - Object Initializer syntax: 
        Properties are set using an object initializer 
        after the constructor call.
   - Constructor parameter assignment: 
   Properties are initialized using values passed to the constructor.

3. Calling a Constructor from the Same Class:
   - Use `this()` keyword: Used to call another constructor in the same class, facilitating constructor chaining.

4. Calling a Parent Class Constructor:
   - Use `base()` keyword: Used to call a constructor of the parent class, initializing the base class before the derived class.
