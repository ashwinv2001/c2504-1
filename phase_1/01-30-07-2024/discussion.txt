    SILENT LISTEN : 
        number of letters - matched 
        same letters to be in both words, 
            arrangements may be different

    NO ON 
    NO NO   

1. Finding my word having vowel or not. 
  Rishwin 
    swith .. case 
2. num is divisible by 3 
    if it is divisible by 3 
    check it divisible by 5 
    nested if..else 

Gayathri:
1. if..else example 
    the number is positive or negative 
 without else "simple if" example 
    to check the number is not zero 
  excellent ->   
    we count the number of "not zeros" in 
    the array of numbers including zeros 
    [10 0 20 30 0 40 0]
    for each num in numbers: 
        if num is not zero:
            count ++
Roshith 
1. Choose the most suitable looping construct for the solution

Nivya 
Write the switch-case statement
example
1. to find the day name for day number 



Dijol 
Write break and continue statements
example for break: 
    isPrime = true 
    for I = 2 .. N-1 // 2 .. N/2  2 .. sqrt(N)
        if N % I == 0:
            isPrime = false 
            break 
        end if 
    end for 
example for continue: 
    sum of all numbers which are divisible by 5 
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 5 != 0:
            continue 
        end if 
        sum+=num 
    end for 


Girish 
I have the solution in while loop. 
Can you solve even in for loop?

Relational Operators in python:
    == != > < >= <= 
    e not in givenset 
Logical Operators in python:
    and or not 

Yahkoob:
    else..if ladder for multiple conditions 
    syntax:
        if(cond1)
            stmts/cond1
        else if(cond2)
            stmts/cond2 
        else if(cond3)
            stmts/cond3 
        ...
        else 
            stmts/else 
    example:
        greatest elements of three/4/5 numbers 
        smallest elements of theree/4/5 number 
    example: 
        to find the grade for given marks 
        else..if ladder 
    example: 
        in binary search 
            to check the mid element is key 
            or key is lesser than mid element  
            or key is greater than mid element 

Aaryaka
    nested while:
        about: while inside while.    
        example: 
            square matrix :
    while inside do..while: 
        example: 


        

Mohammed Riza
    simple..if 
        1. list of numbers 
            to check number is present in the list/arr 
        2. string in list of strings list/arr 
3.
if(box1.text is empty) {
    alert('number1 should not be empty')
    box1.focus()
    return 
}

if(box1.text is not number){
    alert('number1 should be the nubmer')
    box1.focus()
    return 
}

if(box2.text is empty) {
    alert('number1 should not be empty')
    box2.focus()
    return 
}

if(box2.text is not number){
    alert('number2 should be the nubmer')
    box2.focus()
    return 
}


Gopika:
Given a simple problem statement, find the solution and 
			represent the solution as a pseudo code. 

Solve:
check a number is palindrome.
