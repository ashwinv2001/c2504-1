1. Dependency Properties
Dependency Properties are a special type of property in WPF, 
designed to support advanced property functionality, 
such as data binding, styling, animation, and value inheritance. 
They provide more features compared to traditional .NET properties, 
making them essential in WPF development.

a. Dependency Properties
- Dependency properties are registered with the WPF property system and 
managed by the framework, 
which enables features like default values, inheritance, 
and efficient storage.
- Key benefits include:
  - Integration with WPF's data binding and animation system.
  - Change notifications, 
  which are automatically triggered when the property value changes.
  - Memory optimization because the property values 
  are stored only when necessary.

Example:
```csharp
public class MyControl : Control
{
    // Registering a dependency property
    public static readonly DependencyProperty MyProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register("MyProperty", typeof(string), typeof(MyControl),
            new PropertyMetadata("Default Value", OnMyPropertyChanged));

    // CLR wrapper for the dependency property
    public string MyProperty
    {
        get { return (string)GetValue(MyProperty); }
        set { SetValue(MyProperty, value); }
    }

    // Callback method to handle property change
    private static void OnMyPropertyChanged(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Property changed logic
    }
}
```

b. Change Notification
- WPF automatically triggers a notification 
when a dependency property's value changes, 
enabling the UI to update in real-time. 
This is useful for scenarios like data binding, 
where UI elements react to changes in data sources.

c. Property Value Inheritance
- Property value inheritance allows child elements 
to inherit the value of a property from their parent element. 
For example, if a `TextBlock` inside a `StackPanel` 
does not have a `FontSize` explicitly set, 
it can inherit the `FontSize` from its parent.

d. Support for Multiple Providers
- Multiple providers allow the value of a dependency property 
to be set by various sources, such as:
  - Local value: Set directly in XAML or code.
  - Styles and Templates: Set through WPF styling and templating.
  - Data Binding: Automatically updated via a data binding system.
  - Animations: Temporarily changes the property during an animation.

WPF's property system prioritizes these sources, 
using the highest priority value.

2. Routed Events
Routed Events extend the traditional event system 
by allowing events to travel through the UI element tree. 
This makes it easier to handle events 
at different points in the element hierarchy.

e. Routed Events
- Routed events in WPF enable event handling 
beyond just the control that triggers the event, 
allowing events to be routed 
through the visual tree of elements.
- Routed events are defined similarly 
to dependency properties, 
and you can register and raise them 
within your custom controls.

Example:
```csharp
public class MyControl : Control
{
    // Registering a routed event
    public static readonly RoutedEvent MyCustomEvent =
        EventManager.RegisterRoutedEvent("MyCustomEvent", RoutingStrategy.Bubble, typeof(RoutedEventHandler), typeof(MyControl));

    // CLR wrapper for the event
    public event RoutedEventHandler MyCustomEvent
    {
        add { AddHandler(MyCustomEvent, value); }
        remove { RemoveHandler(MyCustomEvent, value); }
    }

    // Raising the routed event
    protected virtual void RaiseMyCustomEvent()
    {
        RoutedEventArgs newEventArgs = new RoutedEventArgs(MyCustomEvent);
        RaiseEvent(newEventArgs);
    }
}
```

f. Routing Strategies
There are three main routing strategies for events in WPF:

- Bubbling: The event is raised from the source element and 
travels up the visual tree to the root element. 
For example, a button click event can be handled 
by the button itself or by a parent container 
like a `Grid` or `Window`. Most user-input events use bubbling.
  
- Tunneling: The event starts from the root element and 
tunnels down the visual tree to the source element. 
This is often used in combination with bubbling. 
WPF tunneling events are prefixed with "Preview", 
like `PreviewMouseDown`.

- Direct: The event is raised and handled by the source element itself. 
Direct routing behaves like traditional .NET events.

Example: Bubbling and Tunneling
```xaml
<Grid PreviewMouseDown="Grid_PreviewMouseDown" MouseDown="Grid_MouseDown">
    <Button Content="Click Me" PreviewMouseDown="Button_PreviewMouseDown" MouseDown="Button_MouseDown" />
</Grid>
```

In this case:
- The `PreviewMouseDown` event (tunneling) starts from the `Grid` and 
moves down to the `Button`.
- The `MouseDown` event (bubbling) starts from the `Button` and 
moves up to the `Grid`.

Summary:
- Dependency Properties provide enhanced functionality 
like change notification, value inheritance, and support for multiple providers.
- Routed Events enable event handling across 
a tree of UI elements with three routing strategies: 
bubbling, tunneling, and direct. 
This makes handling complex UI interactions more flexible in WPF applications.
