OxyPlot is an open-source plotting library 
for .NET applications that is used 
for creating interactive data visualizations and charts. 
It supports a wide range of platforms 
including WPF, Windows Forms, Xamarin, and more. 
OxyPlot is lightweight, flexible, and simple to use, 
making it a popular choice for adding 2D plotting capabilities 
to desktop and mobile applications.

Key Features:
- Supports various chart types such as 
line plots, scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, and more.
- Cross-platform support, allowing you 
to use it in applications built with WPF, Windows Forms, Xamarin, etc.
- Highly customizable with options 
for customizing axes, labels, annotations, markers, legends, and more.
- Zooming, panning, and data interaction support 
for interactive charts.
- Simple and clean API for easy integration and use.

Getting Started with OxyPlot (WPF Example):

Here’s a basic guide to integrating OxyPlot into a WPF project:

Step 1: Install OxyPlot via NuGet
1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and 
select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for OxyPlot.Wpf and install it.

Alternatively, you can run the following command 
in the NuGet Package Manager Console:
```
Install-Package OxyPlot.Wpf
```

Step 2: Define a PlotModel in Your Code
You need to create a `PlotModel`, 
which is the data structure representing your plot. 
This is where you define the series, axes, and 
any annotations you want to display.

```csharp
using OxyPlot;
using OxyPlot.Series;

public class MainViewModel
{
    public PlotModel MyModel { get; private set; }

    public MainViewModel()
    {
        MyModel = new PlotModel { Title = "Example Plot" };
        MyModel.Series.Add(new LineSeries
        {
            Title = "Series 1",
            MarkerType = MarkerType.Circle,
            Points = new List<DataPoint>
            {
                new DataPoint(0, 0),
                new DataPoint(10, 18),
                new DataPoint(20, 12),
                new DataPoint(30, 8),
                new DataPoint(40, 15)
            }
        });
    }
}
```

Step 3: Add OxyPlot to the XAML
To display the plot in your WPF application, 
you need to add the `PlotView` control in your XAML file.

```xml
<Window x:Class="OxyPlotExample.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:oxy="http://oxyplot.org/wpf"
        Title="OxyPlot Example" Height="350" Width="525">
    <Grid>
        <oxy:PlotView Model="{Binding MyModel}" />
    </Grid>
</Window>
```

In this case, the `PlotView` control from OxyPlot 
is bound to the `MyModel` property from the ViewModel. 
You’ll need to set the DataContext in the code-behind 
for the window to reference the ViewModel.

Step 4: Set the DataContext in the Code-Behind
In the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file, set the DataContext 
to the ViewModel that holds the `PlotModel`.

```csharp
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.DataContext = new MainViewModel();
    }
}
```

Types of Plots Supported by OxyPlot:
OxyPlot supports many different plot types, 
including but not limited to:
1. LineSeries: Simple line charts.
2. ScatterSeries: Scatter plots.
3. BarSeries: Bar charts.
4. PieSeries: Pie charts.
5. AreaSeries: Area plots.
6. HeatMapSeries: Heat maps for visualizing 3D data in 2D.

Example of a Bar Chart:
Here’s an example of how to define a bar chart using OxyPlot in C#:

```csharp
using OxyPlot;
using OxyPlot.Series;

public class BarChartViewModel
{
    public PlotModel BarModel { get; private set; }

    public BarChartViewModel()
    {
        BarModel = new PlotModel { Title = "Bar Chart Example" };

        var barSeries = new BarSeries
        {
            ItemsSource = new List<BarItem>(new[]
            {
                new BarItem{ Value = 10 },
                new BarItem{ Value = 20 },
                new BarItem{ Value = 30 }
            }),
            LabelPlacement = LabelPlacement.Outside,
            LabelFormatString = "{0:.00}"
        };

        BarModel.Series.Add(barSeries);
        BarModel.Axes.Add(new CategoryAxis { Position = AxisPosition.Left, Key = "Categories" });
    }
}
```

The corresponding XAML to display the bar chart:
```xml
<oxy:PlotView Model="{Binding BarModel}" />
```

Adding Interactivity
OxyPlot supports zooming, panning, and data tooltips. 
You can enable zooming and panning 
with mouse controls automatically 
by adding axes to your `PlotModel`.

```csharp
MyModel.Axes.Add(new LinearAxis { Position = AxisPosition.Bottom, Minimum = 0, Maximum = 100 });
MyModel.Axes.Add(new LinearAxis { Position = AxisPosition.Left, Minimum = 0, Maximum = 100 });
```

You can customize the interaction model 
by handling events or adding annotations (like tooltips) 
to provide more detailed feedback to users.

Conclusion:
OxyPlot is a powerful, lightweight library 
for creating 2D plots and charts in .NET applications. 
It’s simple to integrate into WPF, 
provides a wide range of plot types, and 
offers interactivity out of the box.
