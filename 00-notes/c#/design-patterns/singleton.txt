Creational Pattern: Singleton

a. Learning Outcome:
The goal is to understand and implement the Singleton pattern, 
a creational design pattern 
that ensures a class has only one instance 
throughout the application and provides 
a global access point to that instance. 

This pattern is particularly useful 
when exactly one object is needed 
to coordinate actions across the system.

b. Practical Example: 
Configuration Manager

In this example, 
we'll implement a `ConfigurationManager` class 
that uses the Singleton pattern. 
This class will manage the configuration settings of an application, 
ensuring that there's only one instance of the manager 
throughout the application's lifecycle.

Singleton Implementation:

```csharp
public sealed class ConfigurationManager
{
    // The single instance of the ConfigurationManager, created eagerly at the time of class loading.
    private static readonly ConfigurationManager _instance = new ConfigurationManager();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private ConfigurationManager() 
    {
        // Initialize configuration settings
    }

    // Public static method to provide a global access point to the single instance
    public static ConfigurationManager Instance
    {
        get
        {
            return _instance;
        }
    }

    // Example method to retrieve a configuration setting
    public string GetSetting(string key)
    {
        // Logic to fetch the setting from a configuration source
        return "SomeValue"; // Placeholder value
    }

    // Example method to update a configuration setting
    public void SetSetting(string key, string value)
    {
        // Logic to update the setting in the configuration source
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. Private Constructor: 
    The constructor is private to prevent other classes 
    from instantiating the `ConfigurationManager` directly. 
    This ensures that the only way 
    to access the `ConfigurationManager` is through 
    the provided `Instance` property.

2. Static Instance: 
    A static, readonly instance of the `ConfigurationManager` 
    is created eagerly when the class is loaded. 
    This guarantees that there is only one instance, 
    and it is thread-safe.

3. Global Access Point: 
    The `Instance` property provides a global access point 
    to the `ConfigurationManager`. 
    Any part of the application can access the single instance 
    using `ConfigurationManager.Instance`.

4. Configuration Management: 
    The `GetSetting` and `SetSetting` methods are examples of 
    how the configuration manager might be used to manage application settings. 
    These methods could interact with a configuration file, 
    a database, or another storage medium 
    to retrieve and update settings.

Usage Example:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Accessing the singleton instance of ConfigurationManager
        ConfigurationManager configManager = ConfigurationManager.Instance;
        
        // Retrieving a setting
        string settingValue = configManager.GetSetting("DatabaseConnectionString");
        Console.WriteLine($"Database Connection String: {settingValue}");

        // Updating a setting
        configManager.SetSetting("DatabaseConnectionString", "NewConnectionStringValue");

        // Again retrieving the updated setting to verify
        string updatedSettingValue = configManager.GetSetting("DatabaseConnectionString");
        Console.WriteLine($"Updated Database Connection String: {updatedSettingValue}");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ConfigurationManager` ensures that all parts of the application use the same configuration settings, which are managed through a single instance. This is critical in applications where consistency and controlled access to resources like configuration settings are important.
