In C#, a "has-a" relationship, 
    also known as composition, 
    occurs when an object contains one or more instances of other objects.

This is a way to model real-world relationships 
    between objects 
    where one object is 
        composed of, or 
        contains, 
            other objects.

Example of a "Has-A" Relationship

Suppose you have a `Car` class, 
    and a `Car` "has a" `Engine`. 

The `Car` class would contain an instance of the `Engine` class.

```csharp
public class Engine
{
    public int HorsePower { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }  // e.g., "V6", "Electric"

    public Engine(int horsePower, string type)
    {
        HorsePower = horsePower;
        Type = type;
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Car
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public Engine Engine { get; set; }  // "Has-A" relationship

    public Car(string make, string model, Engine engine)
    {
        Make = make;
        Model = model;
        Engine = engine;
    }

    public void Drive()
    {
        Engine.Start();
        Console.WriteLine("Car is driving");
    }
}
```

Using the Classes

```csharp
Engine myEngine = new Engine(300, "V6");
Car myCar = new Car("Ford", "Mustang", myEngine);

myCar.Drive();
```

Key Points:

1. Composition: 
    The `Car` class has an `Engine` instance, 
        representing a "has-a" relationship. 
    The `Car` cannot function without an `Engine`.

2. Encapsulation: 
    The `Engine` is encapsulated within the `Car`, 
        meaning the `Car` class controls 
        how the `Engine` is used.

3. Reusability: 
    The `Engine` class can be reused in other classes, 
        such as `Truck` or 
                `Motorcycle`, 
        demonstrating the flexibility of composition.

Benefits of "Has-A" Relationships

- Modularity: 
    You can break down complex systems 
    into smaller, manageable components.

- Reusability: 
    Components like `Engine` can be reused 
    in different contexts.

- Maintenance: 
    It’s easier to maintain and update individual components.

Comparison with "Is-A" Relationship

In contrast to a "has-a" relationship, 
    an "is-a" relationship is modeled using inheritance, 
    where one class inherits from another. 

For example:

```csharp
public class Vehicle
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
}

public class Car : Vehicle  // "Is-A" relationship
{
    public int NumberOfDoors { get; set; }
}
```

Here, `Car` "is a" `Vehicle`, 
so it inherits the properties of `Vehicle`.

Conclusion

The "has-a" relationship (composition) is 
    a fundamental concept 
    in object-oriented design 
    that allows you to model complex objects 
    by combining simpler objects. 

It promotes 
    code reusability, 
    modularity, and 
    maintainability, 
    making it an essential practice 
    in software development.

In object-oriented programming, 
    composition is a design principle 
    that allows a class 
    to be composed of one or more objects of other classes, 
    giving it more complex behavior. 
    
There are different types of composition based on 
    the relationship between 
        the containing object  (the whole) and 
        the contained objects (the parts). 

The two primary types of composition are:

1. Composition (Strong Composition)
- Definition: 
In strong composition, 
the lifecycle of the contained object (the part) 
    is strictly dependent on 
the lifecycle of the containing object (the whole). 
When the containing object is destroyed, 
the contained object is also destroyed.

- Example: 
A `House` class that contains `Room` objects. 
If the `House` is destroyed, 
    the `Room` objects are also destroyed 
    because they do not exist 
    independently of the `House`.

```csharp
public class Room
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Room(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}

public class House
{
    private List<Room> rooms = new List<Room>();

    public void AddRoom(string name)
    {
        rooms.Add(new Room(name));
    }

    // No method to remove rooms directly, implying strong ownership
}

// Usage:
House myHouse = new House();
myHouse.AddRoom("Living Room");
myHouse.AddRoom("Bedroom");
```

   Characteristics:
   - The contained objects (e.g., `Room`) are typically 
        created, 
        managed, and 
        destroyed 
        by the containing object (e.g., `House`).
   - The contained objects cannot exist 
        without the containing object.

2. Aggregation (Weak Composition)
- Definition:    
In aggregation, 
the lifecycle of the contained object 
    is independent of 
the lifecycle of the containing object. 

The contained object can exist independently and 
might be shared with other objects.

- Example: 
A `Library` class that contains `Book` objects. 
The `Book` objects can exist independently of the `Library` and 
can be associated with other libraries or contexts.

```csharp
public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public Book(string title)
    {
        Title = title;
    }
}

public class Library
{
    public List<Book> Books { get; set; } = new List<Book>();

    public void AddBook(Book book)
    {
        Books.Add(book);
    }
}

// Usage:
Book book1 = new Book("The Catcher in the Rye");
Library library = new Library();
library.AddBook(book1);
```

Characteristics:
    - The contained objects (e.g., `Book`) 
            are not necessarily created by 
        the containing object (e.g., `Library`) and 
        can exist independently.
    - The contained objects can be shared 
        among multiple containers.

Key Differences Between Composition and Aggregation

- Ownership and Lifecycle:
    - Composition: 
        The contained object’s lifecycle is tightly coupled with 
        the container's lifecycle. 
        The contained object 
            does not exist 
            outside the context of its container.
    - Aggregation: 
        The contained object 
            can exist independently of the container, and 
            its lifecycle is not tied to the container.

- Cardinality:
  - Composition: 
    The relationship is usually 
        "one-to-one" or 
        "one-to-many," 
        with strong ownership.
  - Aggregation: 
    The relationship can be 
        "one-to-one," 
        "one-to-many," or 
        "many-to-many," 
        with shared ownership.

- Example Real-World Analogies:
  - Composition: 
    A `Car` and its `Engine`. 
    The engine is an integral part of the car and 
    cannot exist without it.
  - Aggregation: 
    A `Classroom` and its `Students`. 
    Students can exist 
    outside the context of the classroom and 
    may belong to multiple classrooms.

Conclusion
    Understanding the difference between 
        composition (strong composition) and 
        aggregation (weak composition) 
    is essential 
        for designing 
            robust and 
            maintainable systems 
        in object-oriented programming. 
    Composition 
        models "part-of" relationships with strong ownership, 
            while 
    aggregation 
        models "part-of" relationships with weaker, 
    more flexible ownership. 
    Both are powerful tools 
        for creating complex objects by combining simpler ones.

Here are examples of cardinality 
    in the context of composition and aggregation:

Composition (Strong Composition)

1. One-to-One:
   - Example: 
    A `Person` and their `Heart`. 
    A person has exactly one heart, and 
    the heart cannot exist without the person.

2. One-to-Many:
   - Example: 
   A `House` and its `Rooms`. 
   A house contains multiple rooms, and 
   each room is part of one specific house.

Aggregation (Weak Composition)

1. One-to-One:
   - Example: 
   A `Student` and their `Locker`. 
   A student may have a locker assigned to them, 
   but the locker can exist independently of the student.

2. One-to-Many:
   - Example: 
   A `Library` and its `Books`. 
   A library contains many books, 
   but each book can exist independently and 
   might be shared with other libraries.

3. Many-to-Many:
   - Example: 
   `Courses` and `Students`. 
   Many students can enroll in many courses, and 
   the courses and students 
   can exist independently of each other.
