Selectors in SQL queries allow you 
to specify the columns you want to retrieve or manipulate. 
These selectors form the core of the 
`SELECT` statement and play a crucial role in data retrieval. 
Here are the main types of selectors used in SQL queries:

1. Column Selectors

a. Single Column
   - Use Case: Retrieve data from a specific column.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves the `FirstName` column from the `Employees` table.

b. Multiple Columns
   - Use Case: Retrieve data from multiple columns.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves the `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age` columns from the `Employees` table.

2. All Columns

a. Asterisk (`*`)
   - Use Case: Retrieve all columns from a table.
   - Example: `SELECT * FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves all columns from the `Employees` table.

3. Derived Columns

a. Aliases
   - Use Case: Rename columns in the result set.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName AS FName, LastName AS LName FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query renames `FirstName` to `FName` and `LastName` to `LName` in the result set.

b. Expressions
   - Use Case: Perform calculations or combine columns.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query combines `FirstName` and `LastName` into a single column named `FullName`.

4. Distinct Selector

a. DISTINCT
   - Use Case: Retrieve unique values from a column or combination of columns.
   - Example: `SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves unique values from the `Department` column.

5. Aggregate Functions

a. COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
   - Use Case: Perform aggregate calculations on columns.
   - Example: `SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Salary), MAX(Age) FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves the total number of rows, the average salary, and the maximum age from the `Employees` table.

6. Subqueries

a. Subquery in SELECT Clause
   - Use Case: Use a subquery to retrieve a value or set of values.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID) AS OrderCount FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query retrieves the `FirstName` and the count of orders for each employee.

7. Case Statements

a. CASE
   - Use Case: Return values based on conditions.
   - Example: `SELECT FirstName, LastName, CASE WHEN Age < 30 THEN 'Young' ELSE 'Experienced' END AS Category FROM Employees;`
   - Explanation: This query categorizes employees as 'Young' or 'Experienced' based on their age.

Using Selectors Together

Selectors can be combined to form complex queries, allowing for powerful data retrieval and manipulation.

Example:
-------------------------------sql-------------------------------
SELECT FirstName, LastName, 
       Department, 
       Salary, 
       Salary * 1.1 AS IncreasedSalary, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID) AS OrderCount,
       CASE WHEN Age < 30 THEN 'Young' ELSE 'Experienced' END AS Category
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 50000
ORDER BY LastName;
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Explanation: 
This query retrieves the first name, last name, department, salary, 
a 10% increased salary, the number of orders, 
and an age category for employees in the IT department 
with a salary greater than 50,000, ordered by last name.

Selectors in SQL provide the flexibility 
to tailor the result set to your specific needs, 
enabling efficient and precise data retrieval.
